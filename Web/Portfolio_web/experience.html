        <h2>Internship</h2>
        <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWithin my study of Software Engineering I got great 
            opportunity to do 6 months internship in <a href="http://www.vandoren.nl">
            Van Doren MES</a> as software developer. During internship I completed
            4 assignments. I worked as individually and as team member. This 
            was very important part of my study, because I used all software 
            development knowledge in practice. I used C# and Java language, 
            worked with SQL Server database, used TL-SQL queries, worked 
            with Android platform, build service/client applications uses 
            RESTful architecture, created web sites with ASP.NET and 
            deployed to IIS. Below are shown links to project descriptions.
