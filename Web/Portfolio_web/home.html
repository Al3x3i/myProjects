                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is my personal web page with the aim to introduce
                  my personal skills and experience in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver the last three years I have learned different areas in
                  software development. I completed 6 moths internship where I worked
                  as software developer. After this period I have experience in
                  user interface development, database development, applications testing, 
                  implementation programming code and writing project documents.
                  For me software development is not only writing code, it is
                  work in team, discussion suitable solutions, to be a team member and constant
                  expansion of skills. After each project I analyze result for
                  my self to become professional software engineer.</br>
