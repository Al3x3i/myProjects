    This project was a part of education program in which I developed windows 
    form application to encrypt and decrypt plain message. In this project 
    possible encrypt and decrypt only 16bit message. For encrypting was used DES 
    cryptographic algorithm.

    The goal of this project was to get overview about cryptography and learn 
    one algorithm. For this project at the beginning I made
    all encrypting/decrypting steps in 
    <a href="../Files/des.xlsx">excel document</a> and then translated into C# 
    code.

    This was very interesting project for me. It was first time when I worked 
    with cryptography and later this experience I used in my internship when I 
    worked with RSA and AES algorithm.
