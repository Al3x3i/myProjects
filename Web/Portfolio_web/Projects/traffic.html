    Traffic simulator is application which simulates traffic jams on crossings. 
    The main function of the program is to simulate traffic based on the inputs 
    defined by the user.
    <br><br>
    The simulation of traffic is an aggregate of many simulations of vehicles 
    making their way from user-defined origins to user-defined and possible 
    destinations upon the user-defined grid. The user is also given the option 
    to override the defaulting directions vehicles take at any particular 
    intersection for the purpose of a more specific simulation. At the end of 
    simulation user may see statistic of traffic simulation.

    In this project I was a project leader. It was good experience to get feeling 
    when you responsible for deliverables and check team members working progress.
    My role in development was working on user interface. All changes on screen, 
    cars movement, crossing plugins, buttons clicks. All these functions and modules
    were implemented by me. As well in this project I used first time my knowledge 
    about threads and implemented for car movement on screen.
