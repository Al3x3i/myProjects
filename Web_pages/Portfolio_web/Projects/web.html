    This was my individual small project for which I created web site in Spanish
    language. I have a small dream once to learn Spanish language. To practice 
    I made web site about one day from my life with comments in 
    Spanish. As well I practiced in JavaScript.

    This web site I made for web development subject. The web site is about my 
    village where I spend a lot of time and I wanted to show part of my 
    childhood to other students. While implementing I used all my knowledge 
    about PHP.
    <br><br>
    Next are listed technical task which I implemented:
</p>   
<ul>
    <li>The index page does not change after page changing. I used php 
        sessions, not a jQuery.</li>
    <li>Made registration form.</li>
    <li>After registration the login and password will be stored in MySQL 
        database.</li>
    <li>Possible upload images with format and size validation.</li>
    <li>After authentication possible to write comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For testing can be used existed login: "admin" and password:"admin"
