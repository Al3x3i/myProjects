    In this project I developed windows application which provides functionality 
    to read data from selected database and display result in table. After that 
    user able to save table in PDF extension. Additionally possible specify max 
    and min range of values for data filtering. It means if value is out of 
    boundaries then it will be highlighted.

    This was my first project where I worked with DevExpress and I learned more
    about DataBinding.
