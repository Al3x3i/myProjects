<h2>Testing</h2>

    During internship I participated in project where I implemented web 
    application testing. The web site was made for 
    <a href="http://www.spgprints.com/">SPG Prints</a> machine to check technical 
    status. When the web site was done team leader asked me test GUI and functionality.
    <br><br>
    Mostly all issues were related with usability and styling. And these issues 
    often happen, because of cross browsers compatibility. To prevent same error
    in different browsers I performed test in different browsers and I used 
    IE-TESTER for testing old version of IE.
    <br><br>
    As well I worked in team where we discussed possible issues and made 
    together decisions.
