    URA App is mobile application for Android platform which allows to store 
    employee working hours for certain projects and see week planning.
    <br><br>
    For this I developed mobile application which makes secure/encrypted 
    connection to the service application, after establishing connection 
    the mobile application receives available projects with tasks. Uses this data 
    user can create or update working hours and send back to the service which 
    will store them in database. 
    <br><br>
    My part of this project to build all needed applications to provide record working 
    hours functionality on Android phones. Next I listed delivered applications:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mobile application (Android platform).</li>
    <li>WCF service application (Service Side) to maintain communication 
        with App.</li>
    <li>ASP.Net Website to manage accounts for URA APP uses Entity Framework
    </li>
    <li>URA App database</li>
    <li>Windows Service application to return week planning which is 
        installed on external server</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Key aspects were using my previous experience for Android
    platform and implementing structured application architecture.
    For SOA I used RESTful architecture principle for client service
    communication. To change weeks was used gestures. On of requirements was
    provide secure connection and for this I implemented SSL connection approach.
    While development I followed Agile methodology and all task were defined for
    each new Sprint.
