    This was a big project where I worked in team and we developed couple 
    applications for the events with certain constraints. My part of this project
    was to develop a shop application. 
    <br><br>
    The purpose of shop application is to allow customers to purchase products 
    uses RFID reader. The idea of using RFID reader is to purchase something
    the customer should do check in of his card at the beginning, then application verify 
    card id in database and shows available amount of money. In this way seller doesnâ€™t
    spent time for counting cash what makes process faster and prevents mistakes. 
    For the young customers the application will automatically impose restriction 
    for purchasing certain products which depend on constraints, for example 
    alcohol drinks. To keep prices and available products constantly updated at 
    each start the application connects to database through internet. From 
    database the application requests necessary information and based on it the 
    product list is automatically updated. This functionality allows to do updates 
    without changing source code of application what makes application maintenance 
    easier.

    For this project I developed not only shop application. My role 
    was to be a member of team. In team we discussed user requirements 
    specifications, functional and not-functional requirements.  Every member of
    team did class diagram and sequence diagram. After we discussed them and 
    chose most suitable solutions.
