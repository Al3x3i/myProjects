    CRM App is mobile application for Android platform which allows 
    retrieve data about the company clients from database which is 
    located on the server. 
    <br><br>
    For this I developed mobile application which makes secure/encrypted 
    connection to the service application, after establishing 
    connection service provides requested information from CRM local 
    database. For authorization on service side are used accounts, which 
    are managed through Admin web site. The Admin web site I created with ASP.NET. To keep CRM database constantly updated I made application which is 
    invoked one time per day to read data from original database and 
    update new fields in CRM database.
    <br><br>
    Below are listed applications which I made for this project
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Android mobile app uses most popular design principles.</li>
        <li>WCF service application which provides CRM database information.</li>
        <li>WCF service application which updates CRM database.</li>
        <li>Console application to derive data from local database and send to service.</li>
        <li>ASP.NET Web application to manage access to data.</li>
    </ul>

    This project was very interesting for me, because I used many new technics
    like: Entity Framework(Code First), IIS, ASP.NET. Further I improved my 
    understanding about MVC pattern for web application. The big challenge was 
    to implement SSL approach with encrypted messageges uses RSA and AES
    encryption. For development I used Agile methodology.
