  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI was born in a small “Tartu” city. Tartu is not very popular and famous for tourists. 
    The city is known more that there is placed Tartu University. I was ordinary young boy and all my teenage life I spend in Tartu. Every weekends I visited my grandfather and grandfather in village. 
    It was great time. Also every school vacation I liked to go to there for whole summer. 
    Same as every young boy I liked play football, catch fish and I had interest in PC. 
    My interest was not only playing games, but was in reading books of new devices, installation operations system, assembling new computes.

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter graduation of high school I moved to another city and started to study professional high education of Wood Processing Technology. 
    I studied applied science and wood productions. We had different subject about trade machine programming where we should write numeric programs and there 
    I got to know with programming. 
    I started to like making logic programs, find new solutions and every improvement in program gave me pleasure. 
    Then every my practice and work was related some kind with programming.

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI graduated professional high education and I started to work. 
    My work was related with trade programming machines and making programs for them. 
    I liked my work and always I had interest to know more. After few years I decided to continue my study in engineering field and changed my work because 
    I education center was in another city. 
    While study I met many people from different countries and they opened view of the world. 
    I like to know new cultures, different traditions and I took decision to try myself to go to live in another country. 
    It was like challenge and after graduation I found a work and moved to Netherlands. 
    My new job also was related with trade machine and making programs. But one day changed all. 
    With me happened an accident at work and I got to hospital. I was lucky and accident was without consequence for health. 
    After this I couldn’t come back to my work and continue to work in production. 
    It was the reason why I made decision to start again and start to gain my professional experience in another field what was always for me interesting and I started to study Software Engineering.

    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMaybe it seems strange that I spend a lot for studies, but always I combined my study and work. 
    Same as now I am focused on my study, work and I use my free time for sport.
