     <b> Old Believers.</b><br><br>
    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPiirissaare is very different from rest of Estonia because of its archaic, ethnic and cultural composition. Most of the habitants are Old Believers who first settled on the island in the 18th century to find a peaceful place beyond the reach of the reforms under the Russian Orthodox Church. 
    <br><br>
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPiirissaare First written documents from the Old Believers church on Piirissaare date back to 1802. Old Believers have been living in a separate community on the island in small settlements, forging a living from fishing and vegetable growing. Preserving this interesting and unique culture is considered an important objective for the area.
